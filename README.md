# LineJustify
This lab demonstrates justifying a line with folding and unfolding, as well as using functions such as find_first_of and getline.
The code takes a line by user input and justifies it to 80 characters.
First, spaces are added after punctuation. If the line is under 80 characters after that process, spaces are added randomly to the line until it is at 80 characters.
